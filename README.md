# NetDevOps

In this simple lab, we will create VLANs in the test and prod environment using Jenkins CI/CD pipeline, Ansible for configuration management and GitHub for SCM (Source Control MAnagement). Microsoft Teams has been connected to the Jenkins CI/CD pipeline so that notification will be sent when the task stated and completed.
